🌸 mori

a quiet space to breathe

 
mori is not a productivity app.
it is a gentle companion for focus.
 

 
what is this?
a pomodoro timer that feels like sitting under cherry blossoms.
no numbers. no pressure. just time, passing softly.
 
why mori?
because adhd brains need calm, not chaos.
because timers shouldn't feel like deadlines.
because you deserve something beautiful.
